# Student Grade Tracker - CodeAlpha Internship

This is a Java-based application developed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. The program allows teachers or administrators to input student grades, store them efficiently, and generate a summary report including the average, highest, and lowest scores.

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Data Storage:** Uses `ArrayList` to store an unlimited number of student grades.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures only valid grades (0-100) are entered.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Automatically calculates:
  * Class Average
  * Highest Scored Grade
  * Lowest Scored Grade
* **Easy Exit:** Users can stop entering data at any time by typing `-1`.

## 🛠️ Requirements
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
* **Terminal/IDE:** Any Java-supported environment (VS Code, IntelliJ, or Command Prompt).

## 📂 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeAlpha_StudentGradeTracker.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeAlpha_StudentGradeTracker.git)
